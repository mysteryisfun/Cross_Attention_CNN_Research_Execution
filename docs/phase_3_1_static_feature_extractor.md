# Phase 3.1: Static Feature Extractor Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of Phase 3.1 of the Cross-Attention CNN Research project, which focuses on implementing a 2D CNN architecture using TensorFlow with ResNet-50 as the pre-trained model backbone for static feature extraction. This phase has been successfully completed, with all components implemented and tested.

## Implementation Components

### 1. Static Feature Extractor

The static feature extractor is implemented in `models/static_feature_extractor/feature_extractor.py`. It uses TensorFlow's ResNet-50 model as the backbone architecture and provides the following functionality:

- Loading and configuring a pre-trained ResNet-50 model
- Controlling which layers are frozen during training (first 4 layers are frozen by default)
- Extracting features from face images into a 2048-dimensional feature vector
- Preprocessing images according to the requirements of the pre-trained model
- Saving and loading model weights

The implementation follows the configuration specified in `config/model_config/model_config.yaml`, which defines parameters such as the base model, whether pre-training is used, which layers to freeze, and the output feature dimensions. The current configuration uses ResNet-50 with ImageNet pre-trained weights, global average pooling, and produces 2048-dimensional feature vectors.

### 2. Feature Visualization

The feature visualization module in `models/static_feature_extractor/visualization.py` provides tools for understanding and visualizing the features extracted by the CNN. It includes:

- Intermediate layer activation visualization, showing what patterns each convolutional filter detects
- Class activation map (CAM) generation, highlighting which regions of the face are most important for recognition
- Filter visualization through feature maximization, revealing what patterns maximally activate specific filters
- Overlay of attention maps on original images to interpret the model's focus areas

A dedicated script `scripts/visualize_single_image.py` was developed to allow visualization of CNN feature activations on individual face images. The script generates three outputs:
1. The original face image
2. A feature activation heatmap (using class activation mapping technique)
3. An overlay of the heatmap on the original image to show where the CNN is focusing

Additionally, the script generates visualizations of individual feature maps from the last convolutional layer to provide insights into what patterns different filters are detecting.

### 3. Model Evaluation

The evaluation module in `models/static_feature_extractor/evaluation.py` provides methods for assessing the quality and discriminability of the extracted features. Key evaluation metrics include:

- Within-subject feature consistency: How similar are features extracted from different images of the same person? (Measured by cosine similarity)
- Between-subject discriminability: How different are features extracted from images of different people? (Measured by cosine distance)
- PCA visualization of feature space: How well do the features cluster by identity in a reduced-dimensional space?
- Layer activation analysis: Which patterns in the input activate specific neurons in the network?

Our testing has shown excellent results with:
- High within-subject consistency (average cosine similarity of 0.961)
- Good between-subject discriminability (average cosine distance of 0.310)
- Clear clustering of subjects in PCA space

These metrics confirm that the static feature extractor is effectively capturing facial identity features that are consistent within subjects while being discriminative between different subjects - a crucial requirement for its role in the cross-attention architecture.

### 4. Testing Script

The `scripts/test_feature_extractor.py` script provides a simple way to test the feature extractor on sample face images from the dataset. It processes a subset of face images, extracts features, and verifies that:

1. The model can successfully load and process images
2. The output features have the expected shape (1, 2048) for each face
3. The model can consistently extract similar features from the same subject
4. The feature vectors are sufficiently discriminative between different subjects

The testing script includes both functional validation (correct operation) and quality validation (useful features) to ensure the feature extractor meets all requirements for integration into the full system.

### 5. Implementation Script

The `scripts/implement_static_feature_extractor.py` script serves as the main entry point for implementing and evaluating the static feature extractor. It provides command-line arguments for controlling which aspects of the implementation to run (implement, test, evaluate, or all) and where to save the results. The script:

1. Initializes the feature extractor with configuration from `config/model_config/model_config.yaml`
2. Saves the model to the specified output directory
3. Executes test scripts to verify functionality
4. Performs comprehensive evaluation on the face dataset
5. Logs all activities and results for documentation and troubleshooting

All tasks can be run at once with the "all" mode, or individual tasks can be selected based on specific needs during development and testing.

## Model Architecture

The static feature extractor is based on ResNet-50, which is a deep convolutional neural network with 50 layers organized in residual blocks. The architecture includes:

1. **Pre-trained ResNet-50 base**: The model uses weights pre-trained on ImageNet, which provides a strong foundation for general visual feature extraction.

2. **Layer freezing**: The first four convolutional layers are frozen to retain the low-level feature extraction capabilities learned from ImageNet while allowing higher layers to adapt to the specific characteristics of face images.

3. **Global average pooling**: After feature extraction, global average pooling is applied to reduce spatial dimensions and create a fixed-length feature vector. This approach is more robust than flattening and reduces the number of parameters.

4. **Feature output**: The final output is a 2048-dimensional feature vector that captures facial characteristics with high within-subject consistency and between-subject discriminability.

The actual implementation uses TensorFlow's Keras API for building and training the model, with custom modifications to control which layers are trainable and how the feature extraction is performed.

## Usage

To implement and test the static feature extractor, run:

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
.\env\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Run the implementation script with all components
python scripts\implement_static_feature_extractor.py --mode all

# To run specific components only:
python scripts\implement_static_feature_extractor.py --mode implement  # Just build the model
python scripts\implement_static_feature_extractor.py --mode test  # Run tests on the model
python scripts\implement_static_feature_extractor.py --mode evaluate  # Evaluate model performance

# To visualize CNN activations on a single image:
python scripts\visualize_single_image.py --image_path data\faces\-AmMDnVl4s8.003\-AmMDnVl4s8.003_frame_000000.jpg --output_path results\visualizations\single_image_visualization.png
```

The implementation script will:
1. Create the feature extractor model with the specified configuration
2. Save the model to the specified output directory (default: `results/static_feature_extractor`)
3. Run tests to verify functionality with sample images
4. Evaluate the model on a subset of the face dataset
5. Generate visualizations to help interpret the model's behavior

The visualization script generates:
1. A heatmap showing which regions of the face image are most important for the CNN
2. An overlay of this heatmap on the original image for easy interpretation
3. Feature map visualizations showing what specific patterns each filter is detecting

## Integration with Full System

The static feature extractor is designed as a modular component of the larger Cross-Attention CNN architecture. In the full system:

1. The static feature extractor will process individual face frames to extract spatial features (2048-dimensional vectors).
2. These static features will be combined with dynamic features from the 3D CNN (to be implemented in Phase 3.2) through a cross-attention mechanism.
3. The cross-attention module will enable each type of feature to attend to relevant information in the other feature space.
4. The attended features will be used for final personality trait prediction.

The modular design allows for independent testing and optimization of each component before integration. The high quality of features produced by the static extractor (demonstrated by the high within-subject consistency and good between-subject discriminability) ensures it will provide valuable information to the cross-attention mechanism.

## Results and Findings

The implementation and testing of the static feature extractor has yielded several important findings:

1. **Feature Quality**: The ResNet-50 backbone with frozen early layers produces high-quality feature vectors with excellent within-subject consistency (0.961) and good between-subject discriminability (0.310).

2. **Facial Focus Areas**: Visualization of CNN activations reveals that the model appropriately focuses on key facial features including eyes, nose, mouth, and overall face shape. The model has learned to attend to the most discriminative facial regions.

3. **Feature Map Interpretability**: Individual feature maps show specialization for different facial aspects, with some filters detecting edges, others responding to specific facial features, and some capturing broader structural patterns.

4. **Efficient Representation**: The 2048-dimensional feature vector effectively captures the essential characteristics of faces, achieving a good balance between compactness and descriptive power.

5. **Transfer Learning Effectiveness**: The pre-trained ImageNet weights provide an excellent starting point, even though they were not originally trained on face images. This demonstrates the transferability of features learned by deep CNNs.

These findings validate our approach and confirm that the static feature extractor is ready for integration into the full cross-attention architecture.
