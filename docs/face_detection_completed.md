# Face Detection and Alignment System

## Overview

The face detection and alignment system has been fully implemented. This system:

1. Detects faces in video frames using MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks)
2. Aligns faces based on eye positions to standardize orientation
3. Crops and resizes faces to a consistent format
4. Saves processed face images for further analysis

## System Components

The system consists of the following components:

1. **Core Face Detection Module**: `scripts/preprocessing/face_detector.py`
2. **Command-line Interface**: `scripts/process_faces.py`
3. **Analysis Tool**: `scripts/analyze_face_detection.py`
4. **Documentation**: `docs/face_detection.md`

## How to Use

### Step 1: Extract Frames from Videos

Before detecting faces, extract frames from the video files:

```bash
python scripts/extract_frames.py --video-dir "data/raw/train-1/training80_01" --output-dir "data/processed/frames" --sampling-rate 5 --max-frames 100 --resize 224x224
```

### Step 2: Process Frames to Detect and Align Faces

Process the extracted frames to detect and align faces:

```bash
python scripts/process_faces.py --input-dir "data/processed/frames" --output-dir "data/faces" --confidence 0.9 --min-size 80 --target-size 224x224 --visualize
```

### Step 3: Analyze Face Detection Results

Generate a comprehensive analysis of the face detection results:

```bash
python scripts/analyze_face_detection.py --face-dir "data/faces" --output-dir "results/visualizations"
```

## System Features

### Face Detection

- Uses MTCNN for state-of-the-art face detection
- Configurable confidence threshold to filter out low-quality detections
- Option to detect multiple faces or focus on the largest face
- Parallel processing for efficiency

### Face Alignment

- Aligns faces based on eye positions
- Standardizes face orientation for consistent input to neural networks
- Adds appropriate margins around faces
- Resizes to a consistent resolution

### Logging and Visualization

- Comprehensive logging of detection and alignment process
- Visualization of success rates and processing statistics
- Analysis of face detection results across the dataset

## Best Practices

1. **Confidence Threshold**: Adjust the confidence threshold based on your dataset. Lower values will detect more faces but may include false positives.
2. **Processing Parameters**: Tune the minimum face size and target size based on your specific requirements.
3. **Multi-processing**: Adjust the number of workers based on your system's capabilities for optimal performance.
4. **Batch Processing**: For large datasets, consider processing in batches or using the recursive option.

## Next Steps

Now that the face detection and alignment system is complete, the next steps in the pipeline are:

1. Develop the optical flow computation module
2. Build the data augmentation pipeline
3. Create the preprocessing failure handling system
